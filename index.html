				<h2>About plastics</h2>
				<p>There’s enough plastic in the world to outweigh the mass of all Earth’s mammals. Ain’t that something? Though the fossil fuel companies that produce all this plastic (and simultaneously pollute nearby neighborhoods) are at fault, we should also take a look in the mirror. How much plastic do you consume? Every dollar we spend is a vote, so every time we buy plastic, we’re telling those companies to keep on producing it.</p>
